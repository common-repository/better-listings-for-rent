Gets your DoorLoop property listings and display them in an interactive way instead of using iframe and gives you styling and SEO freedom.

== Description ==

“Listings for DoorLoop” is a simple light-weight property listing plugin that allows you to list your rental properties on your WordPress site from your DoorLoop account using a shortcode.

The old iframe method of showing doorloop rental listings does not allow site owners to customize the styling and improve SEO. This plugin will give you freedom to make any changes to the listings page.
All your doorloop rental listings will be shown in an interactive way which you can customize using CSS easily.

Shortcode: **[lfdl_listings]**
where you want to show the listings. A full-width page is recommended for good styling.

Notice: This is an unofficial plugin and is not linked with DoorLoop directly.

You will need to enter your buildium account page URL in the plugin settings that looks like this - https://app.doorloop.com/api/mits/other/6340895f9db48e5ec0b5e6df
